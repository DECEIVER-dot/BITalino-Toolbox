### Libraries needed ##############################################################################

library(data.table) ### for t-test building fileslibrary(readr) ### read CSV file

library(psych) ### A general-purpose toolbox developed originally for personality, psychometric theory and experimental psychology.

library(lpSolve) ### software for solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs.
library(irr) ### Coefficients of Interrater Reliability and Agreement for quantitative, ordinal and nominal data: ICC, Finn-Coefficient, Robinson's A, Kendall's W, Cohen's Kappa
ICC(data) ### test to determine the reliability of scores through evaluating the range of various scores of the equal individual to the whole version throughout all scores and all individuals.
